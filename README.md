General Summary of LRSM_MGI_012_RND_L_Axis_Pert_MC.py
This script is used for Monte Carlo simulations of shell buckling with Localized Reduced Stiffness Method (LRSM) in Abaqus. It:

Generates random perturbations along the shell structure based on predefined Z-parameters.
Creates and assigns stiffness properties for the reduced stiffness regions.
Automates Abaqus finite element model generation, job submission, and result extraction.
Computes buckling loads and perturbation sizes and stores them for further analysis.
Uses a randomized approach to test different configurations for improved statistical reliability.
This script is essential for probabilistic buckling analysis and optimization of imperfection-sensitive shell structures.
